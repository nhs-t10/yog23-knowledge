CV is computer vision. To utilize it, create a pipeline (documentation at software/cv/making-a-pipeline.md). That goes into the nitty-gritty of cv processing (or it will, at least), so this is more about CvManager itself, being the integrating bridge between the two. This includes:
1. Common errors, and how to fix them (please add your own as you find them).
2. Initializing the camera
3. Calling pipeline functions (It's more complicated than it sounds. Seriously. This caused ~1/2 the bugs I had to fix when learning about CV)
4. Which of the many functions you can ignore. I'll be trying to clean those up, but you may have to finish the job.

So, in order:
1. Common Errors. Please skip this until you understand parts 2 and 3, or this will confuse and befuddle you.

If your CV is printing nothing, or weird results, when you do telemetry.log(output), odds are high you are calling the wrong pipeline. Make sure that your constructor's pipeline_index value is the right thing, and that the three pipelines at the top are also right.

2. Before using CV, you have to initialize the camera.
