# General Information

`Managers` are basically just fancily named Java classes, and they house all of the functions we use for AutoAuto and TeleOp.

If you want to add a new function to a `Manager`, it's as simple as a standard function declaration in Java.

The following `Managers` are not documented in this folder:

`AutocorrectionManager`: This has mostly been made obselete by `RoadRunnerManager`, and has never been fully tested.

`bigArmManager`: This is a year-specific manager for 2022-2023 Power Play, and likely won't be useful in future years. 
However, it's left in the codebase as a reference if you want to make your own manager.

`NateManager`: This is a year-specific manager for 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy, and likely won't be useful in future years. 
However, it's left in the codebase as a reference if you want to make your own manager.
