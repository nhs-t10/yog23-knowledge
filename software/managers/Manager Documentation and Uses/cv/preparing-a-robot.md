# Preparing a Robot for OpenCV

This should be done whenever a new robot is being set up.

Follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV#installation-instructions-android-studio) to install OpenCV on the robot. It is likely that steps 1-6 are completed already (those stay in the code), but **the most important step is step 7. Step 7 works on the robot itself, and your code will crash if you don't have step 7 completed**.
